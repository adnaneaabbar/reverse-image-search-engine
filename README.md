# Creating an image classification search engine using CNNs 

This project's main purpose is to mimic Google's Image Search Engine, working with a large enough dataset we will try to achieve the best results we can.

---

First you should load the dataset from Darknet : [Here](https://pjreddie.com/projects/cifar-10-dataset-mirror/)

Second, you should put in the root of your project following this structure :



```
. project
+-- your_notebook.ipynb
+-- dataset
|   +-- train       ==> this contains your 50.000 training images
|   +-- test        ==> this contains your 10.000 training images
|   +-- labels.txt  ==> this contains your classes

```
